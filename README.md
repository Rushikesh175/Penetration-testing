As a part of CCBP Foundations, we have performed Penetration Testing on
metasploitable2 and identified the vulnerable apps in it. We have exploited one of
the vulnerable apps in the system and assessed the level of risk.
During the assessment, we have identified 1 HIGH-risk issues, 1 MEDIUM risk issues,
and 0 LOW-risk issues.
In addition, we have also performed Open Source Intelligence Gathering on a
predefined target and identified publicly available information.
